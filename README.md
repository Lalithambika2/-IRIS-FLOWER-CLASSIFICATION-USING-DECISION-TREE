# -IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION-USING-DECISION-TREE
  # Introduction
    The Iris Flower Classification project is a machine learning-based application designed to classify Iris flower species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—using the Decision Tree algorithm. The project demonstrates the effective use of Python libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib for building and evaluating a predictive model.

    This project is a great example of applying supervised learning techniques to solve a real-world classification problem, leveraging decision trees to make interpretable predictions.
